# HOW TO GET A HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIP
## Standard vs Standout
##### Standard
      * Existing program
      * Conventional wisdom dictates how you can get the opportunity; there is a clear procedure
      * They reach out to you
      ** Referred to by school, advertisements, etc.
      * Boring work, menial and/or manual labor
##### Standout
      * WOW Factor
      * If you ask someone you meet on the street, “How do you think I got this internship?” and they can’t answer, then it’s impressive
      * You actually have to explain what it is you do
## How do you actually get the internship?
##### Resume
      * Compile ALL the things you did in the past few years in a doc
      * Make a copy of doc and Emphasize points related to what you’re applying to
##### Cover Letter
      * Explain why you want to work there
      * What can you bring to them (skills, personality, etc.)
